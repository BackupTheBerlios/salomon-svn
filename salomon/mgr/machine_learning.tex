%POCZATEK \\
%Human in vitro fertilization involves collecting several eggs from a woman’s
%ovaries, which, after fertilization with partner or donor sperm, produce several
%embryos. Some of these are selected and transferred to the woman’s uterus. The
%problem is to select the “best” embryos to use—the ones that are most likely to
%survive. Selection is based on around 60 recorded features of the embryos—
%characterizing their morphology, oocyte, follicle, and the sperm sample. The
%number of features is sufficiently large that it is difficult for an embryologist to
%assess them all simultaneously and correlate historical data with the crucial
%outcome of whether that embryo did or did not result in a live child. In a
%research project in England, machine learning is being investigated as a technique
%for making the selection, using as training data historical records of
%embryos and their outcome. \\
